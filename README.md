# School District Analysis
## Purpose
Academic dishonesty is not tolerated in any capacity, and after learning that the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School (THS) had evidence of being altered, Maria turned to our data analytical skills to help her solve the problem. We first filtered through the data and replaced all the 9th grade THS students math and reading scores with NaN, and then reran our school district analysis with the new updated values. This led to new math and reading passing percentages, as well as new overall passing percentages for THS. This affected our school district analysis we had conducted with Maria which I will be outlining in the results below.

## Results
### District Summary
  - The original district summary can be seen below:

  - When we compare it with the new updated numbers, taking the 9th grade students out of the calculations we get this result:

  - As you can see, all the results have gone slightly down- with 15 schools in the district, and only taking out ONE grade from ONE high school- our numbers were affected on a district level. This could be used as evidence of how the 9th grade students at THS altered their grade to be higher than they normally would be.

### School Summary
  - Looking at THS in the school summary originally we had these results:

  - Running our new analysis taking out the 9th graders at THS we can see a slight change in THS scores:

  - THS scores were all consistently were lower when taking out the 9th graders, with the exception of Average Reading Score which went up 0.05%.
  - If we step back and look at the top 5 schools in the district we see that THS ranks as #2 in overall passing %:

### Replacing 9th grade scores and their effect:
  - We replaced all the 9th graders at THS reading and math scores with NaN due to evidence that there might be academic dishonesty- this can be seen in all the tables generated by grade as a "NaN" value in place of 9th grade students at THS for both math and reading as opposed to their previous values of 83.6% and 83.7% for math and reading respectively:

  - The difference in scores by school spending can be seen below:

  - THS different scores can also be seen when sorted by school size as shown below:

  - Finally we can sort by school type and compare the scores before and after our analysis:

## Summary 
  - There have been some major and minor changes due to replacing the 9th grade scores with NaN; the district comprising of 15 schools saw a minor change in scores from 0.1-0.3% because that one grade at the lone high school is a very small percentage of the entire district. If we look at just Thomas High School though- we see the biggest changes because that grade level compromised of a quarter of the entire school. The biggest change was the overall passing % going down from 90.94% to 90.63%. If we look at THS change in scores by size we also see no discernable change due to that group of schools by size being so large. Lastly when looking at the schooly by type, charter or district, we saw no change in the numbers, this is due to the fact that we are looking at an entire district, only broken up into two categories so one high schools single grade level being taken out doesn't affect it significantly.
